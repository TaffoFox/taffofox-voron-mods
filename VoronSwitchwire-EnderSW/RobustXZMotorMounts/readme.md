This mod is intended for the Voron Switchwire "Ender Conversion", more specifically boubounokefalos' conversion which can be found at https://github.com/boubounokefalos/Ender_SW. This modification is based off Triano's mod which will work also.

Although Switchwire's stock motor mounts work, they are prone to bending, shifting and generally not being secure enough to what I would like.

This mod adds another mounting point which secures the motor mount to the Z 2040 extrusions. It prevents the motor mounts from bending on the X and Y axis.
There is also another screw at the bottom of the tensioner which holds the two printed pieces together more firmly. I found that on stock motor mounts, these parts tend to bend out far, depending on how much tension is put on to the mount.

These motor mounts will likely not work on the original Switchwire since they are shortened in order for them to fit Ender frames, however, in the future I may add an option for this. I do not yet have a stock Switchwire to test fit with.
 
 Parts required:
 - 2x M3x5 BHCS (Z mounting)
 - 2x M3x30 SHCS (securing the two pieces together better)
 - 2x M3 Heatset insert (for above screws to screw into)
